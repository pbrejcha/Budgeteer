Peter - 9/14 {
	I figured that we could just keep a log of what we're doing and any ideas we have re:the project.
	I created a models notes page to get some ideas about what kind of back-end models we'll need for the initial sprint.
	
	My idea for this first sprint is to simply have a page where a user can faux-login, then view a page of their accounts, click into those and get a quick summary of their remaining balance and transactions. Regarding authentication, I figured it could just be simple mock-authentication, but I'm also open to using some Express authentication framework if you want. I found this: http://everyauth.com/ and it looks like it has a lot of support and appears to be fairly straightforward. 

	I'm not sure how formal of agile you wanted to go with this, but I'm down for any real management strategies, whether that be simply setting a date to complete this first sprint by, or even hashing out some real tasks in some project management app (tasky? :-P).
